# Up and Running with AngularJS


## Installation

To get this server up and running, do the following:

* Install [Node](http://nodejs.org)
* Type `npm install` the first time to get the server's dependencies
* Type `node index.js` to start the server
* Go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser. The port number can be changed in `index.js` if necessary

## Using the exercise files

This server has a folder named `public`. Each exercise file set has a `public` folder you can use in place of the one distributed with this server. Simply replace the old folder with the one from the exercise files.
